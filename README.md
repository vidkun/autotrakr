This project is every bit as much to solve my own problem as it is a means for
me to learn and explore new technologies, such as mongodb, background workers (sidekiq),
and haml. It is also an opportunity for me to strengthen my skills in other areas 
such as testing, coffeescript/javascript, and other rails patterns.

I enjoy wrenching on my own vehicles and have yet to find a decent solution for
enthusiasts to track and manage their personal vehicles. Every solution so far 
is geared more towards companies that need to manage their fleet of business
vehicles.

Autotrakr is intended to allow individuals to add vehicles to their garage and
track the maintenance of those vehicles and build a profile to show off these 
vehicles. Users can add photos to their vehicle records, track what parts and upgrades
have been added to the vehicle, add service records to track routine maintenance,
add service reminders based on customizeable service intervals, and maintain a list
of consumable products perferred for routine maintenance such as part numbers for:
oil filters, air filters, fuel filters, different fluids, etc.

Feel free to submit pull requests or open issues if you have any.
